-- Estimates of the lens mass require independent measurements of the fringe spacing imprinted on the lensed waveform and the level of amplification of the fringe oscillations
-- Can expect the interference fringe in the lensed waveform whenver the time delay (which depends only on the mass of the lens, to leading order) between the images is comparable with the GW period --> The GW sources to be used should be comparable in mass to the lens <-- This is assuming a point-mass lens model
-- For galaxies and galaxy clusters, a common, more realistic lens model is that of singular isothermal spheres, in which case the Einstein ring and time delay are related to the velocity disperson of stars or galaxies rather than the lens mass 

[Old note (not sure about relevance): y parameter can be determined from amplitudes of lensed signals, but amplitude is degenerate with luminosity distance and intrinsic mass scale of merger. Being able to spatially distinguish lensed images would provide an additional measurement of y, allowing to break this degeneracy. Measurement of the time delay between lensed images allows for inferences of cosmological parameters. If want to  measure the total mass of a cluster, the Einstein ring would be ~ tens of arcseconds (with assumptions about the cluster mass and the distances). Better angular resolution will allow for measurements at greater distances.]",,,Toni,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.10773.pdf; https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.03213.pdf; https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.01479.pdf
