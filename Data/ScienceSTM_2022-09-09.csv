More accurate distance estimates require knowledge of the binary inclination angle--breaking the degeneratcy between inclination angle and luminosity distance would require detecting either higher-order modes or measuring both + and x polarizations using multiple GW detectors! [Toni's note: The necessary localizations I found in the literature were 20 deg^2 with current and 3rd-gen. GW detectors, based on limiting optical observations to four pointings with the Vera Rubin Observatory. I set the required precision to 1 deg on the theory that we'd be doing much better if we could limit observations to 1 pointing. That being said, this is much bigger than what we're targeting with a GWI. With the localizations we have been talking about for the GWI, we'd probably do better pursuing the technique of matching GW sources to galaxy catalogs in order to get the redshifts. But this would probably be a bread-and-butter technique by the time we would have the GWI.]",need galaxy catalogs for galaxy identification,"GRB detections require jet-on, it's going to be a fraction of the events",Cecilia,Toni,https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/abf502
