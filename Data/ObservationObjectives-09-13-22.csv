Sesana 2008 [https://arxiv.org/abs/0806.0624] suggests that EM counterpart will have a luminosity around $\sim 10^{43}$ erg/s (Eddington luminosity of $10^5 M_\odot$ BH), which they claim can be measured out to ~200 Mpc w/ last generation of telescopes. This seems to be the limiting piece. However, MacLeod 2014 [https://arxiv.org/abs/1405.1426] shows luminosity in the range of  $\sim 10^{48}$ erg/s for a $0.5 M_\odot$ WD + $10^5 M_\odot$ MBH. Assuming normal scaling relations of brightness falling off like $1/r^2$, increase of $10^5$ in luminosity would allow you to see $10^{2.5} \approx 300$ times farther, so maybe you could see out to $\sim 6\times 10^{4}$ Mpc. That seems kind of far, like $z\sim 6$. Need to discuss this in more detail with folks. Maybe more realistic would be $\sim 10^{46}$ erg/s leading to a $10^{1.5} \approx 30$ increase in distance, so only see out to $\sim 6 \times 10^{3}$ Mpc",,,,

Pfister 2021 [https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.05883]: Detection rate depends on $(M_\mathrm{BH}, m_\mathrm{MS}, \beta, z)$, the BH mass, MS* mass, penetration factor, and redshift. Most probable source for LISA: $(M_\mathrm{BH}, m_\mathrm{MS}, \beta, z) = (5\times 10^5 M_\odot, 10 M_\odot, 20, 5\times 10^{-3})$. This leads to an observable TDE rate $\sim 10^{-4}$ for SNR $\sim 10$. Most probable source for DECIGO: $(M_\mathrm{BH}, m_\mathrm{MS}, \beta, z) = (10^4 M_\odot, 1 M_\odot, 200, 5\times 10^{-1})$. This leads to observable TDE rate of $\sim 10^{2}$ for SNR $\sim 10$. Redshift seems to have the strongest impact on detection rates, with the log of the detection rate scaling roughly like $z^3$. Therefore, the most gain can be made by detecting farther signals. So we can either adopt the ideal DECIGO system or something like an optimal LISA source but with a slightly lower mass and increased optimal redshift. Really need to do a full analysis w/ mission concept sensitivity curve to figure out whether these signals will be observable w/ future GW detector. Note that we only focus on MS plunge orbits and not WD plunges since WD rates are about 100 times smaller than MS* rates per [https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.06612.pdf].",,,,
